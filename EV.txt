
Each EV file is a text file containing three columns of numbers. 
Column 1: Onset Time
•	This column indicates when an event or block starts, measured in seconds from the beginning of the fMRI run.
•	For example, if you see "10" in this column, it means the event started 10 seconds after the run began.
Column 2: Duration
•	This column shows how long the event or block lasts, also in seconds.
•	For block designs (like win.txt or loss.txt), this might be longer (e.g., 15 or 30 seconds).
•	For event-related designs (like win_event.txt, loss_event.txt, or neutral.txt), this is typically shorter, often matching the stimulus presentation time (e.g., 1 or 2 seconds).
Column 3: Amplitude
•	This column is usually set to 1 for task-based fMRI, indicating that the event occurred.
•	In some cases, it might vary if you're modeling different intensities of stimuli, but for most standard analyses in the Gambling task, it will be 1.
Example interpretations:
1.	In win.txt or loss.txt (block design): 30 15 1 This means: 
o	A block started 30 seconds into the run
o	The block lasted for 15 seconds
o	Standard amplitude of 1
2.	In win_event.txt, loss_event.txt, or neutral.txt (event-related): 45.5 1.5 1 This means: 
o	An individual trial started 45.5 seconds into the run
o	The trial lasted for 1.5 seconds
o	Standard amplitude of 1
