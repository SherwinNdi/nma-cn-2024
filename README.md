**Neural Response to Neutral Stimuli in Reward and Loss Contexts: A GLM and Representational Dissimilarity Analysis of the HCP Gambling Task**


**Project Description**



**Overview**
This project investigates how the brain processes neutral stimuli within different emotional contexts, specifically in predominantly rewarding or losing environments. Leveraging data from the ``Human Connectome Project (HCP)``, we utilized a ``gambling task`` to explore neural responses to neutral outcomes and how these responses are influenced by the surrounding reward or loss context. The primary analytical methods employed include the ``General Linear Model (GLM)`` and ``Representational Dissimilarity Analysis (RDA)``.



**Objectives**
To understand if and how the brain's response to neutral stimuli varies between reward and loss contexts.
To identify specific brain regions that exhibit differential activation in response to neutral stimuli in these contexts.
To highlight the importance of contextual information in modulating neural responses.


**Methods**

Data Source:<br>
The HCP dataset was used, incorporating fMRI data from participants performing a gambling task (based on Delgado et al., 2000).<br><br>
Task Design:<br>
Participants guessed if a mystery card was above or below five, with correct guesses earning rewards and incorrect ones leading to penalties. Neutral trials were also included.<br><br>
GLM Analysis:<br>
Modeled brain responses to neutral stimuli in predominantly win versus loss blocks.<br><br>
RDA:<br>
Compared neural representations across different contexts to reveal how context-dependent processing alters neural patterns.<br><br>


**Key Findings**<br>

> _Contextual Influence:_ The brain processes neutral events differently in predominantly win blocks compared to loss blocks.<br>
> _Significant Regions:_  43 brain parcels exhibited significant differences in activity in response to neutral events depending on the context.<br>
> _Activation Patterns:_  Distinct neural activation patterns emerged in regions such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior insula. <br>
> _Implications:_  Emotional context significantly alters neural processing of neutral stimuli, underscoring the brain's sensitivity to environmental framing.<br>

**Conclusion**<br>
The study concludes that the processing of neutral stimuli is highly context-dependent, with emotional framing significantly impacting neural activation patterns. This emphasizes the role of contextual information in shaping neural responses to seemingly neutral outcomes. Future research is recommended to explore trial-by-trial variability in these neural responses to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
